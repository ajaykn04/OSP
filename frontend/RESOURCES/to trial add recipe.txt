1 3/4 cups (220g) all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar
3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 cup (240ml) milk
1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup (240ml) boiling water




1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed until well combined.
4. Stir in the boiling water. (The batter will be thin.)
5. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
6. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove from pans and cool completely on a wire rack before frosting.
